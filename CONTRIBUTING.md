# Contributing

Please raise issues for discussion before opening PRs (or ideally before starting to write code changes) for large or breaking changes,
just to save time if its not the direction we want to take the project.

For small changes (anywhere from typos to non-breaking bug fixes) going straight to a PR is fine, but not required.
