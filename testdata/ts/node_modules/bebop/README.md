# Bebop for TypeScript

This is the [Bebop](https://github.com/RainwayApp/bebop) runtime for TypeScript.

It exports the `BebopView` class used by the code that `bebopc` generates. (You shouldn't need to use `BebopView` directly: you only call the methods on the classes that `bebopc` generates for your schema messages.)

For more information, see: [Getting started with TypeScript](https://github.com/RainwayApp/bebop/wiki/Getting-Started-with-TypeScript) on the Bebop wiki.
